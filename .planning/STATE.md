## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Init]: Single obs.jsonl (not two files) -- NTFS locking; observer filters by agent_id presence
- [Init]: Categorical confidence (HIGH/MED/LOW) -- LLMs cannot calibrate numeric scores
- [Init]: Pending Review sections as lightweight staging -- no staging directory
- [Init]: pipeline-observe.sh already exists (342 lines) but needs hardening for main conversation capture

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 1 has existing code (pipeline-observe.sh, 342 lines) -- plan must account for refactor vs rewrite decision
- Phase 2 observer prompt engineering is the hardest design problem (per research)
- Phase 3 /evolve UX within CLI context needs prototyping (research flag)
